# ‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ | ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á | Namaste | üôè

Welcome to my homepage! I am a second year PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am on study leave from my Lecturer position in Information Technology at [Government Polytechnic Daman](https://gpdaman.in/). I was selected for the Lecturer position through [UPSC](https://www.upsc.gov.in/). Prior to that, I worked as an Assistant Professor at [Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology](https://smu.edu.in/smit.html/). During my M.Tech. I worked on an industry sponsored project on Sentiment Analysis at [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/). I completed my Bachelors and Masters from [Assam University, Silchar](http://www.aus.ac.in/).

My research focuses on various aspects of computational linguistics. In the past, I have worked on scholarly document processing, legal document processing, novelty detection, sentiment analysis and dialogue summarization. For my PhD, I am working on NLP for mental health.

In my free time, I love to travel and take photographs (see my Instagram profile). On social media, I am most active on LinkedIn and least active on Facebook.
